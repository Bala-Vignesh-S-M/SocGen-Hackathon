# SocGen-HackathonAbstract: 

Greetings, we've opted for the third problem statement: "Matching of job openings with skill database using machine learning"

Our approach involves employing the word2vec model on a dataset sourced from data science websites. The primary objective is to extract skillsets, specifically various collections of data science skills. Following this skillset extraction, we proceeded to process resumes (in PDF format) using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract textual content.

This extracted content is then compared against job prerequisites, specifically the required skills, to determine the individual's suitability for the given role. To conduct this assessment, we take the job requirements and the resume as inputs, evaluating their alignment (using the intersection of vectors).

It's important to note that our current dataset only covers data science skills due to the data scraped from data science websites. However, this methodology has the potential to be extended to encompass roles beyond the scope of data science.

Word2vec: 

Word embedding is one of the most popular representations of document vocabulary. It is capable of capturing the context of a word in a document, semantic and syntactic similarity, relation with other words, etc.

Optical Character Recognition: 

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the process that converts an image of text into a machine-readable text format. For example, if you scan a form or a receipt, your computer saves the scan as an image file. You can use OCR to convert the image into a text document with its contents stored as text data.

We extend our gratitude for affording us the chance to present ourselves in this hackathon. We eagerly anticipate your response and look forward to hearing from you.
